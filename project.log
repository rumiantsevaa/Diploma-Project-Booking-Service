A GitHub repository has been created: https://github.com/rumiantsevaa/Diploma-Project-Booking-Service.
Access has been configured for the team. The designer has been added to the project as a collaborator and can work in their own branch: /design.
A domain name for the website has been rented on the nic.ua portal bbooking.pp.ua. The domain is valid for one year.

Updated the domain’s Nameservers (NS) to Cloudflare’s to manage the domain through Cloudflare.
Added bbooking.pp.ua to Cloudflare, enabling performance, security, and encryption features.
Updated DNS records, including: A CNAME record for www.bbooking.pp.ua, pointing to rumiantsevaa.github.io, and set proxy status to Proxied for security.

Initially, the custom domain in GitHub Pages was set to bbooking.pp.ua. 
This setup led to DNS resolution issues due to GitHub's restrictions on using CNAME for the root domain (bbooking.pp.ua).
The solution was to change the custom domain to www.bbooking.pp.ua in GitHub Pages, as GitHub Pages can support a CNAME record for subdomains like www. 
This fixed the DNS issue and allowed proper routing of the custom domain.

The website is now accessible at https://www.bbooking.pp.ua/.
Cloudflare’s security and performance features are active, including HTTPS encryption.
GitHub Pages automatically builds and deploys the site whenever changes are made to the main branch on GitHub in the /docs folder, ensuring the site is always up to date with the latest changes.
